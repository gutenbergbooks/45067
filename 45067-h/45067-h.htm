      Laborer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has worked with his muscles, his brain and his pen,
    </p>
    <p>
      For ages, to ransom the children of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reformer in politics, morals, and law,
    </p>
    <p>
      The noblest example the world ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true type of progress for each generation,
    </p>
    <p>
      He works out his problems in every nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every man he does what he can,
    </p>
    <p>
      And never diverges one jot from his plan;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lays his foundation in human equality,
    </p>
    <p>
      And this, he affirms, is the only right polity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To old Plymouth Rock, with the Pilgrims he came,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wilderness echoed the notes of his fame;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he worked with a will, till the top-stone was laid,
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Temple of Freedom, the house he had made.

    <p>
      So Jack had designed, ere the House he began;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so deep, and so wide did he lay the foundation,
    </p>
    <p>
      That it took half the continent for its location.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter; the larger the better, thought Jack,
    </p>
    <p>
      For millions of Freemen will soon find the track
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Human Redemption out here in the West,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, free from oppression, the weary may rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, up went the Pillars, from ocean to ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, out spread the Roof-Tree midst wildest commotion;
    </p>
    <p>
      A glorious banner then waved from its dome!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Liberty shouted: "This, <i>this</i> is my home!"

      What Cow, beside her, cropped the rich, flowery mead,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or drank of the stream which her thirst had relieved;

    <p>
      Sheep, Horses and Oxen&mdash;nay, even the Ass,

      And she yielded the richest abundance of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened, one day, that the ill-favored hound

    </p>
    <p>
      The ruin of each beast in the National Lot.

    <p>
      But the Dog was transformed! and a demon was there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Incarnate and hidden, beneath the whelp's hair;
    </p>
    <p>
      Divinity issued its fiat of Fate,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dog-fiend stood ready to launch forth its hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      With demoniac rage, and a terrible roar,
    </p>
    <p>
      That none but a fiend ever uttered before,
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprung to his work of destruction and death,

    <p>
      Intending to finish it up with a breath!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Cow made a bow at the game he was trying,
    </p>
    <p>
      Put her horns to his ribs, and then&mdash;sent him up-flying!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he wonder is, not
      that he's tattered and torn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That his garments are faded, and ragged, and worn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That his features are bronzed, and his visage is marred&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That his limbs are all bruised, and his body all scarred;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonder is, how, in such terrible strife,
    </p>
    <p>
      He has struggled so nobly and come out with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the heaven-born instinct that nerved his brave spirit
    </p>
    <p>
      A Temple to build, for the Free to inherit,
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired him with courage, enduring and true,
    </p>
    <p>
      That Temple to save and its foes to subdue;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he vowed that his work forever should be
    </p>
    <p>
      Preserved and respected, blest, happy, and free!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cost of much blood, and his doublet and hose,
    </p>
    <p>
      (For a man is a <i>man</i>, in despite of torn clothes,)
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack has labored, and suffered, by day and by night,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he knew that his cause was just, holy, and right:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Goddess of Liberty smiled through her tears,
    </p>
    <p>
      As her brave-hearted champion so war-worn appears;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with mingled emotions of sadness and bliss,
    </p>
    <p>
      She embraced her young Hero, and&mdash;gave him a kiss!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e comes, and his
      advent betokens the fate
    </p>
    <p>
      That Despots and Tyrants all trembling await.
    </p>
    <p>
      He comes! and the clank of the chains as they fall
    </p>
    <p>
      From the captive, proclaim him the Savior of all!
    </p>
    <p>
      He comes! and the doors of the prison fly open,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bond are set free by the word he hath spoken!
    </p>
    <p>
      He comes! and before him all darkness and night
    </p>
    <p>
      Flee away at his presence! for He <i>is</i> the Light!
    </p>
    <p>
      The altar is raised, and the priest is at hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      All shaven and shorn, at the altar to stand;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, through the land, the whole nation rejoices;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sound of great waters they lift up their voices!
    </p>
    <p>
      A marriage! a marriage! a wedding so rare
    </p>
    <p>
      The world never saw; and such a glorious pair!
    </p>
    <p>
      No emperor or king&mdash;no hero of old,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though decked in the treasures of purple and gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      Could compare in his royalty, splendor and pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      To the patriot Workingman claiming his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      No queen, though her form should be peerless in grace&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the smile of a seraph illumined her face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Could compare with sweet Liberty, matchless, divine,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood in her loveliness there at the shrine;
    </p>
    <p>
      And angels smiled down from their home in the skies,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bowed ones of earth wiped the tears from their eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the spirits of patriots rejoiced to behold
    </p>
    <p>
      The dream of their labors so brightly unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Union! A Union! that nothing shall sever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Free Labor and Liberty wedded forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest at his labors, by word and by deed,
    </p>
    <p>
      In active benevolence none could exceed;
    </p>
    <p>
      In season and out, at all times of the year,
    </p>
    <p>
      If his presence was needed he'd surely be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would weep with the mourner, rejoice with the gay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And help, with a blessing, the poor on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Untiring, incessant, he grudged every minute
    </p>
    <p>
      That kept him from work&mdash;for his heart, it was in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lark was too late with its carol so sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      As it soared in the morning the sunshine to greet;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest could not slumber so long on his bed,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he knew that his Master had not, for his head,
    </p>
    <p>
      A pillow to rest on; and <i>he</i> would not dare
    </p>
    <p>
      To refuse, in degree, his privations to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      But listen! The cock, with a shrill chanticleer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclaims, by his voice, that the dawning is near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awake, Priest, awake! To thy labors once more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Away to the Temple, God's grace to implore
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day&mdash;on the nuptials&mdash;and on this great nation,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus gathered to witness the New Life's celebration!
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of the multitude sound through the air;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells peal their echo to hearts far and near;
    </p>
    <p>
      Haste, haste to the altar&mdash;thy vesture gird on!
    </p>
    <p>
      A nation of freemen to-day are new-born,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the clarion of fame sends the tidings afar,
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Right with the Might are triumphant:
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrah!
